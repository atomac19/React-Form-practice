# React Form
I wrote my first React form from scratch for practice. 
## Description
My React form is for a school administrator. The form have input fields for:
- First name
- Last name
- Age
- Address
- Homeroom class number
- Student ID

As the user inputs the student's data in each field, the inputted values are updated and showing on the screen for them to see that it is being received.
Also, the form has radio-type input to allow the user to track a student's favorite lunch option.
